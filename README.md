## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** (notebooks are tested with Python 3.11.13)
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab** access
- Basic understanding of machine learning and natural language processing

### Running the Notebooks

#### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)
Each notebook includes a "Open in Colab" badge at the top. Simply click it to run the notebook directly in Google Colab with all dependencies pre-installed.

#### Option 2: Local Jupyter
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/michaelwnau/google-agents-intensive.git
   cd google-agents-intensive
   ```

2. Install required dependencies (check individual notebooks for specific requirements):
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter notebook
   # Additional dependencies will be listed in each notebook
   ```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Navigate to the desired day folder and open the notebook files.
