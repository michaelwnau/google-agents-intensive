This is a crucial and often overlooked step in drug discovery, as finding the right biological target is fundamental to developing an effective treatment.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into what AI is doing in this area:\n\n**What is a \"Drug Target\"?**\n\nA drug target is typically a molecule in the body that a drug can interact with to produce a therapeutic effect. This is most commonly a protein (like an enzyme or a receptor) but can also be RNA or even DNA. The idea is that by modulating the activity of this target (e.g., inhibiting an enzyme that's overactive in a disease, or activating a receptor that's underactive), you can alleviate disease symptoms or halt its progression.\n\n**Why is Target Identification and Validation Difficult?**\n\n*   **Complexity of Biology:** Biological systems are incredibly intricate. Diseases often arise from the dysregulation of multiple genes, proteins, and pathways, not just a single \"culprit.\"\n*   **Vast Data Landscape:** We now generate enormous amounts of biological data from sources like:\n    *   **Genomics:** DNA sequencing data to understand genetic variations associated with diseases.\n    *   **Transcriptomics:** RNA sequencing data to understand gene expression levels.\n    *   **Proteomics:** Studying the proteins in cells or tissues.\n    *   **Metabolomics:** Studying small molecules (metabolites) involved in biological processes.\n    *   **Clinical Data:** Patient records, medical histories, and outcomes.\n*   **Lack of Prior Knowledge:** For many diseases, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still not fully understood.\n*   **\"Undruggable\" Targets:** Even if a target is identified, it might be difficult for a drug to bind to it effectively or safely.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification and Validation:**\n\nAI excels at finding patterns and making predictions from massive, complex datasets – precisely what's needed here.\n\n1.  **Integrating Multi-Omics Data:**\n    *   **What it is:** AI algorithms can integrate data from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and other \"omics\" fields.\n    *   **How it helps:** By combining these different layers of biological information, AI can paint a more comprehensive picture of how genes, proteins, and metabolites are altered in a diseased state compared to a healthy state. This helps pinpoint key molecules that are consistently disrupted.\n    *   **Example:** An AI might identify a protein that shows increased RNA expression (from transcriptomics) and is also found in higher quantities (from proteomics) in cancer cells, suggesting it's a critical player in the tumor's growth.\n\n2.  **Network Biology and Pathway Analysis:**\n    *   **What it is:** AI can model biological systems as complex networks of interacting molecules.\n    *   **How it helps:** Instead of looking at molecules in isolation, AI can analyze how they interact within signaling pathways or regulatory networks. This helps identify \"bottlenecks\" or \"master regulators\" whose inhibition or activation could have a broad therapeutic effect. It can also uncover compensatory mechanisms that a disease might use, suggesting multiple targets.\n    *   **Example:** AI might reveal that a particular kinase is a central node in a network driving inflammation, making it a prime candidate for an anti-inflammatory drug.\n\n3.  **Literature Mining and Knowledge Graphs:**\n    *   **What it is:** AI (specifically Natural Language Processing - NLP) can \"read\" and understand millions of scientific papers, patents, and clinical trial reports.\n    *   **How it helps:** It can extract relationships between genes, proteins, diseases, and drugs that humans might miss due to the sheer volume of information. This information can be organized into \"knowledge graphs\" that represent this complex biological knowledge in a structured way.\n    *   **Example:** An AI might discover a hidden link between a gene previously studied for one disease and a completely different disease based on subtle mentions in the literature, suggesting a potential new therapeutic area.\n\n4.  **Predicting Target Druggability:**\n    *   **What it is:** Once a potential target is identified, AI can analyze its structure and known interactions.\n    *   **How it helps:** AI models can predict the likelihood that a small molecule or antibody can bind to the target and elicit a desired effect, or conversely, that it might interact with off-target molecules, leading to toxicity.\n    *   **Example:** AI can analyze the 3D structure of a protein to identify pockets where a drug could bind, or flag potential liabilities (like binding to a critical protein in healthy tissues).\n\n5.  **Analyzing Genetic Association Studies:**\n    *   **What it is:** AI can sift through large-scale genetic studies (like GWAS - Genome-Wide Association Studies) that link specific genetic variations to diseases.\n    *   **How it helps:** It can help prioritize which genes identified in these studies are most likely to be causal drivers of the disease, and therefore, good drug targets.\n    *   **Example:** If a genetic variation is linked to a higher risk of Alzheimer's, AI can analyze the function of the affected gene and its protein product to determine if it's a viable target for a drug that could reduce that risk.\n\n**Companies and Impact:**\n\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals** uses AI to analyze vast imaging datasets of cells treated with various compounds, identifying potential drug targets and mechanisms.\n*   **BenevolentAI** uses its AI platform to mine scientific literature and integrate diverse datasets to discover novel drug targets and therapies.\n*   Many large pharmaceutical companies are also investing heavily in internal AI capabilities for target identification.\n\nIn essence, AI is transforming target identification from a process that was often reliant on serendipity, intuition, and painstaking manual research into a more systematic, data-driven, and predictive endeavor. This significantly increases the chances of finding the right \"key\" to unlock the \"lock\" of a disease.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the main companies involved in **AI for Target Identification and Validation**.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
